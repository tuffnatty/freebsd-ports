The Windows-compatible header and IDL files provided by the mingw-w64 project.

The mingw-w64 project is a GNU Compiler Collection based compiler toolchain
targeting Microsoft Windows. Forked from the now inactive mingw.org project
in 2007, it has since added support for Win64, WinARM, updated header files,
and new GCC versions. It supports numerous Microsoft APIs, and can build
executables, DLLs, COM components, and kernel-mode device drivers.
